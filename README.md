# Mew-SchedGen

First official Mew project! Creating a schedule generating application for Camp IHC. The application will allow the camp to easily and efficiently generate schedule on rain days, or any sort of day, with all sorts of specifications on particular activites, such as double period activites, those that occur with adjacent age groups, and those that occur for either just girls or boys as well. The GUI is intuitive and sleek as well. The objective here is to alleviate the stress from having to piece together a complex schedule, ensuring more time to enjoy the summer and make countless camp memories! ~ Ryan & Ryan
